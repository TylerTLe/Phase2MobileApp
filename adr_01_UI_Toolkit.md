### Status
- *Decision Made*
### Context
- *The mobile app is focused on calorie tracking, and the user interface needs to be intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient for users to log and track their daily calorie intake.*
### Decision
- *We will use React Native Elements as the UI toolkit for building the user interface of the calorie tracking mobile app.*
### Consequences
- *React Native Elements provides a comprehensive set of cross-platform UI components and styling options, making it well-suited for building a modern and visually appealing UI for the app.*
- *It offers a wide range of pre-designed UI elements such as buttons, cards, and input fields that can be easily customized to match the app's design requirements.*
- *React Native Elements is built on top of React Native, making it a suitable choice for cross-platform development, which reduces development effort and cost.*
- *The toolkit is well-documented and has an active community, ensuring that developers can find support and resources as needed during development.*
- *While React Native Elements covers many UI needs, some platform-specific features or highly customized components may require additional native code integration.*
- *Its familiarity to developers who are already experienced with React Native and JavaScript makes it an efficient choice for development.*
