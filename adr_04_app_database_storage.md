#  Database storage
### Status
- *Decision Made*
  
### Context
- *The context for this decision is the development of a calorie-tracking app that needs to manage and store various types of data, including user account information, order history, and restaurant menu data. The choice of a database storage system is crucial to efficiently handle these different data types.*
  
### Decision
*We have decided to use a combination of relational databases and NoSQL databases for our weight tracking app:*
- ***Relational Databases:***
  - *We will utilize relational databases such as PostgreSQL to manage structured data, specifically user account information and order history. These databases provide a structured and organized way to store data with defined schemas, ensuring data integrity and consistency.*
    
- ***NoSQL Databases:***
  - *For semi-structured data like restaurant menu data, which may vary between restaurants, we will employ NoSQL databases like MongoDB.NoSQL databases are more flexible and schema-less, allowing us to efficiently store and retrieve variable data structures.*
    
### Consequences
*The consequences of this decision are as follows:*
- ***Efficient Data Management:***
  - *Using relational databases for user account information and order history ensures efficient management of structured data, providing strong data consistency and reliability.*
- ***Flexibility:***
  - *By incorporating NoSQL databases for restaurant menu data, we gain flexibility to accommodate variations in menu items between different restaurants without the need for frequent schema modifications.*
- ***Complex Data Synchronization:***
  - *To ensure data synchronization between the app and restaurant inventory systems, we will need to implement robust APIs and data transformation processes. This complexity arises from the combination of structured and semi-structured data, as well as the need to interact with external systems.*
- ***Development and Maintenance:***
  - *Utilizing both relational and NoSQL databases may increase the development effort, as developers will need to be familiar with both types of databases. Additionally, ongoing maintenance and data migration between these two types of databases may present challenges.*
