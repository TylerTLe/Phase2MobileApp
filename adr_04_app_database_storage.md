#  Database storage
### Status
- *Decision Made*
  
### Context
- *The context for this decision is the development of a calorie-tracking app that needs to manage and store various types of data, including user account information, meal information and user stats. The choice of a database storage system is crucial to efficiently handle these different data types.*
  
### Decision
*We have decided to use a NoSQL databases for our calorie-tracking app:*    
- ***NoSQL Databases:***
  - *NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra offer flexible schema designs. In a calorie tracking app, user-generated data can vary widely. Users may have different preferences, and new data fields could be introduced over time. NoSQL databases allow you to store data without a fixed schema, making it easier to adapt to changes and accommodate a variety of data formats.*
  - *Calorie tracking apps can experience variable workloads, especially with changing user activity patterns and seasons. NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more servers or nodes to handle increased data volume and traffic. This scalability is crucial for maintaining app performance during peak times.*
  - *NoSQL databases are optimized for specific use cases, including fast read and write operations. In a calorie tracking app, quick access to user data and the ability to record updates or new entries are essential. NoSQL databases can efficiently handle these tasks, providing low-latency response times.*
  - *NoSQL databases can efficiently handle real-time data and support features like notifications and real-time updates. Users of calorie tracking apps often want to see immediate updates in their daily intake and progress, which NoSQL databases can facilitate.*
### Consequences
*The consequences of this decision are as follows:*
- ***Efficient Data Management:***
  - *Using relational databases for user account information and order history ensures efficient management of structured data, providing strong data consistency and reliability.*
- ***Flexibility:***
  - *By incorporating NoSQL databases for restaurant menu data, we gain flexibility to accommodate variations in menu items between different restaurants without the need for frequent schema modifications.*
- ***Complex Data Synchronization:***
  - *To ensure data synchronization between the app and restaurant inventory systems, we will need to implement robust APIs and data transformation processes. This complexity arises from the combination of structured and semi-structured data, as well as the need to interact with external systems.*
- ***Development and Maintenance:***
  - *Utilizing both relational and NoSQL databases may increase the development effort, as developers will need to be familiar with both types of databases. Additionally, ongoing maintenance and data migration between these two types of databases may present challenges.*
