### Status
- *Decision Made*
### Context
-  *The app requires a backend system to handle user accounts, payment processing, order management, and data synchronization with restaurant inventory systems.*
### Decision
- *We will use the Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript).*
### Consequences
- *Node.js is well-suited for building scalable and real-time applications.*
- *It allows for efficient handling of asynchronous tasks, such as real-time order tracking and push notifications.*
- *A large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks is available for Node.js, simplifying development.*
- *The choice of Node.js may require hiring or training developers with expertise in JavaScript.*
