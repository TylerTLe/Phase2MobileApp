# Hardware
### Status
- *Decision Made*
### Context
- *Our team is developing a calorie-tracking app, where user interaction with hardware components should be intuitive and efficient to support the user's journey of logging and tracking their daily calorie intake. The app's design and functionality hinge on the careful selection and integration of specific hardware features.*
### Decision
- *Considering the app's focus, the hardware components chosen are:

1. **Touchscreen Interface**: For easy data entry and navigation.
2. **Camera**: To scan barcodes or capture images of foods for easy logging.
3. **Notifications (via Speaker)**: Audio cues for reminders to log meals or updates on daily calorie counts.*
### Consequences
- **Touchscreen Interface**: Enables intuitive interactions but demands a responsive and user-friendly UI design.
- **Camera**: Enhances user experience for food logging but requires effective integration with a database for food information retrieval.
- **Notifications**: Improve user engagement but need to be customizable to avoid intrusion.

### Attribution
- **Team Member A**: Will optimize the touchscreen interface ensuring the UI is responsive and intuitive.
- **Team Member B**: Is responsible for integrating and testing the camera functionality, focusing on barcode and image recognition accuracy.
- **Team Member C**: Will handle the notification system, ensuring it’s user-friendly and not intrusive.

These decisions, made with the app’s focus and user experience in mind, are documented and will guide the development process ensuring alignment with the project’s goals and timeline.
