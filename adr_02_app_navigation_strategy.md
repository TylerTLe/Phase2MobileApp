# Navigation Decision Document

### Status

Accepted by team

### Decision

We have decided to implement a bottom navigation bar for our web app to facilitate easy navigation across the platform.

### Assumptions

- **Simplicity for New Users**: Our primary goal is to make the app user-friendly, especially for new users who may not be familiar with the platform.

- **Simple Navigation**: The navigation system should be straightforward and not overly complex, ensuring that users can find what they need easily.

- **Limited Icons and Links**: We anticipate that only a few icons and links are required for app navigation.

### Constraints

- **Offline Usage**: All data must be stored locally on the user's device to enable offline functionality. This requirement may influence data storage and synchronization approaches.

- **Quick Navigation**: It's essential that users can access functions and features swiftly. 

### Navigation Options

We have considered various navigation options:

1. **Navbar at the Top**: A traditional approach that may be less user-friendly on mobile devices.

2. **Navbar on the Bottom**: A common design choice for mobile apps, making it more user-friendly and easily accessible with one hand.

3. **Menu Button**: Tapping a button to reveal the menu conserves screen space but adds an extra interaction step.

4. **Navigation Drawer**: Users swipe to reveal navigation icons, offering a clean interface but potentially less discoverable.

5. **Search Bar**: While useful for finding specific content, it might not serve as the primary method for navigating the app.

### Recommendation

Given our objective of creating a simple, flexible app, we recommend using a bottom navigation bar. It's a user-friendly choice for mobile apps and aligns with our assumptions of simplicity and quick navigation. Careful design of the navigation items and hierarchy is essential to ensure key features are easily accessible.

As we move forward, let's also plan for scalability and flexibility in our navigation structure to accommodate future changes without a major overhaul. Additionally, consider the mechanisms for offline data storage and synchronization as required.

User testing and feedback should be integral to the development process to confirm that our chosen navigation design meets users' needs and expectations.
