### Status
- *Decision Made*
### Context
- *The client has requested the development of a mobile app for food ordering and delivery/pickup services. The team needs to decide whether to build a native app, a web app, or a hybrid app.*
### Decision
- *We will develop a native mobile app for iOS and Android platforms.*
### Consequences
- *Native apps provide the best performance, user experience, and access to device features like GPS, camera, and push notifications.*

- *It requires separate development efforts for iOS and Android, potentially increasing development time and costs.*
